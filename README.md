## Branches

### Original model
Original : Code optimizated compared to the [the original repo](https://github.com/shanybar/event_entity_coref_ecb_plus) leading to faster training time

### Ablative models
NoStatic            : Removed GloVe embedding from orignal model
NoContext           : Removed Elmo embedding from orignal model
NoChar              : Removed character embedding from orignal model
noctx-static        : Removed Elmo and GloVe embedding from orignal model
noctx-static-char   : Removed all embedding from orignal model

### Comparative models
GPT-2               : Replace Elmo with GPT-2
BERT                : Replace Elmo with BERT     
FastText            : Replace GloVe with FastText 
Word2Vec            : Replace GloVe with Word2Vec

### Comparative ablative models
Onlybert            : Removed GloVe and character embedding from orignal model + Replace Elmo with BERT
OnlyGPT             : Removed GloVe and character embedding from orignal model + Replace Elmo with GPT-2            
OnlyELMO            : Removed GloVe and character embedding from orignal model             
onlyfasttext        : Removed GloVe and character embedding from orignal model + Replace GloVe with FastText                
onlyword2vec        : Removed GloVe and character embedding from orignal model + Replace GloVe with Word2Vec                  
onlyglove           : Removed GloVe and character embedding from orignal model
